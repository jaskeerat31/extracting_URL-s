# extracting_URL-s
Here i have used OCR and pytesseract to extract links from images in Python.

Why I built this?
 Whenever we have an event such as an hackathon or workshop we get the banner or poster of the event with the registration link, we need   to refer the image and type the damn characters in the browser which is very annoying.
 
It extracts links from Images and automatically opens browser and directs us to that link using webbrowser package of python.

Installation
pip install pillow
pip install pytesseract
